== Research Experience

*Integrated Planning of Multi-Charging Facilities (MTCF) and Urban Distribution Network*, 2022.9-2024.7

National Natural Science Foundation of China (52007123)

- Performed a comprehensive literature review on EV charging station planning in urban distribution networks.
- Proposed a two-step equivalence relaxation method for MTCF and developed a dynamic traffic network model for autonomous EVs.
- Formulated a stochastic planning model to address EV spatiotemporal uncertainties, analyzing costs across various scenarios, including congested traffic hubs.

*Joint Planning of Active Distribution Network (ADN) and EV Charging Stations (EVCS)*, 2021.9-2022.8

National Natural Science Foundation of China (52007123)

- Established an integrated model for ADN and EVCS considering vehicle-to-grid and reactive power support.
- Decomposed the large-scale MISOCP problem into MILP and MISOCP sub-problems to enhance solution efficiency.
- Modeled distributed generation resources such as energy storage, photovoltaic systems, capacitor banks, static VAR compensators, and on-load tap changers.
- Analyzed reactive power support planning results for EVs and multiple distributed generation resources.

*Simulation Analysis of Transient Thermal Effect of Ground Wire-Suspension Clamp System*, 2019.9-2020.6

National Natural Science Foundation of China (51977083)

- Built a three-dimensional electromagnetic-thermal coupling simulation model for a ground wire-suspension clamp system wrapped with aluminum armor tape.
- Analyzed current density and temperature distribution under power-frequency short-circuit currents.
- Investigated the influence of different bolt torques on the ground wireâ€™s peak temperature.
